# gipson-hello

This is Alexis Gipson's repository/GitHub page! Welcome!

This repository is just for my future assignments, but I did want to introduce myself a little. 

I am a junior at Eastern Michigan University. I am currently 20 years old at the time of writing this, but I am going to be turning 21 years old in just about four days. I am a Simualtion, Animation, and Gaming major, and I hope to be a concept artist, character designer, or script writer after I graduate from the program.
